            Frame Styleguide serves as a digital brand guideline to building websites and experiences. The goal of a styleguide is to improve consistency, quality and communication across the UI, making the design and development process more efficient and focused.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Styleguide is to establish a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.

          <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
          <p>
            Anyone who is designing or developing a new website using Frame. Even if you donâ€™t need to use these components directly, the base styling and documentation should be a useful reference for how we have done stuff elsewhere and to reduce duplication of work and contaminating the style sheets.
